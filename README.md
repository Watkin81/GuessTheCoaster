## About GuessTheCoaster
GuessTheCoaster is a Discord Bot created and owned by me where users have to guess the name of a roller coaster from a large selection of roller coaster images. Correct answers reward credits, streaks and completion which can be viewed on a user profile or on local/global leadboards.

The Bot is coded in **JavaScript** with help from Nodejs v18, Discordjs v14, and Mongodb.
