## About GuessTheCoaster
GuessTheCoaster is a Discord Bot created and owned by me where Users have to Guess the Name of a Roller Coaster from a large selection of roller coaster images. Correct answers reward Credits and Completion which can be viewed on a User Profile or on Local/Global Leadboards.

The Bot is coded in **JavaScript** with help from Nodejs v18, Discordjs v14, and Mongodb.

More information reguarding the bot and a discord invitation can be found at the link below:
